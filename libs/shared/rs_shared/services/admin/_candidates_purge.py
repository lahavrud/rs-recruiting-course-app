    A candidate is purged only when *every* one of their applications meets
    all three conditions:

    - linked Job is CLOSED
    - linked Job.updated_at is more than ``CANDIDATE_RETENTION_DAYS`` ago
    - the application's own status is not HIRED

    A candidate with even one application that is still active, recently
    closed, or HIRED is preserved — companies may still need that data for
    payroll / dispute resolution. New candidates with no applications at
    all are also preserved (no expiry has started).

    Resume files are best-effort deleted from storage before the DB row
    is removed; storage failures are logged and ignored so a partial S3
    outage cannot block compliance deletions.
